# MSBX 5420 Assignment 4

In this assignment, you are going to work on three tasks - (1) perform graph (network) analysis with spark graphframes on a social network data from Facebook, (2) perform graph analysis on graph data from reddit, (3) read data from MySQL database and do a simple analysis. The tasks are described below, and what you need to do is to complete the missing code in the jupyter notebook *assignment4.ipynb* and submit the notebook.

Collecting network type of data is sometimes not easy, and the most influential data source for network analysis is the data collection from SNAP library (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/). Here we use two datasets from the data collection - one is the Facebook network data, and the other is reddit hyperlink data. Facebook network data is used for task 1, and reddit data is used for task 2. For task 3, we will use the example database from MySQL, as shown in the class exercise in week 10.

You are strongly suggested to use docker to work on the tasks. If you don't have docker available, or you want to speed up the process, you may use MyBinder (class official one [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/msbx5420-class/msbx5420-class.github.io/HEAD)) and EMR cluster but with several limitations (note that MySQL is *NOT* available for MyBinder, and only the *second* cluster has graphframes and MySQL available). When using EMR cluster, you need follow the commented code to load packages and read files from S3. Please follow the rules in project instruction to create the directories if you intend to use the second cluster created for project.
