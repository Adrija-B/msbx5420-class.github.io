# MSBX 5420 Assignment 4

In this assignment, you are going to work on three tasks - (1) perform graph (network) analysis with spark graphframes on a social network data from Facebook, (2) perform graph analysis on graph data from reddit, (3) read data from MySQL database and do a simple analysis. The tasks are described below, and what you need to do is to complete the missing code in the jupyter notebook *assignment4.ipynb* and submit the notebook.

Collecting network type of data is sometimes not easy, and the most influential data source for network analysis is the data collection from SNAP library (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/). Here we use two datasets from the data collection - one is the Facebook network data, and the other is reddit hyperlink data. 

You are suggested to use docker to work on the task. If you don't have docker available, or you want to speed up the machine learning training process, you may use MyBinder (class official one [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/msbx5420-class/msbx5420-class.github.io/HEAD)) and EMR cluster with several limitations (MySQL is NOT available for MyBinder, and only the *second* cluster has graphframes and MySQL available). When using EMR cluster, you need follow the commented code to read packages and files from S3. Please follow the rules in project instruction to create the directories if you intend to use the second cluster created for project.
